# NEVADA
Simple 2D game made in C with SDL2

Just to learn C and SDL.

## Used libraties

- SDL2
- libxml2
- lua53

[Example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6En8dlul6A)

## Main goals

- I've no idea what kind of game it would be ;)
- level entirely generated from .tmx (TiledMap Editor) map file (including templates and tilesets)
- use Lua as scripting language (I plan to use scripts that would be attached to various objects in the game)
- some graphics improvements
